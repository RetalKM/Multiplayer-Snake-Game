# Multiplayer Snake Game

Snake Game  is a networked version of the classic Snake game built as a distributed application. It allows multiple players to connect to a central server and play simultaneously. The system was developed using core networking modules in Python such as socket, threading, and selectors. The project was created for the Distributed Programming course, and was aimed at enhancing understanding of concurrency, client-server architecture, and modular game design.

# Features

	•	Real-time multiplayer functionality
	•	Server-client architecture using TCP sockets
	•	Independent input handling via multithreading
	•	Random food generation using the random module
	•	Clear flowchart and modular logic
	•	Basic error handling and command-line flexibility

# Technologies Used

	•	Language: Python
	•	Modules:
	•	socket – for networking
	•	threading – to handle concurrent clients
	•	selectors – for asynchronous I/O
	•	random – for unpredictable item placements
	•	sys – for command-line arguments
